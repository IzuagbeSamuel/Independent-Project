    <h1>WELCOME TO <strong>COOPVET</strong></h1>
    <p>Homelessness is a growing problem in the Nigeria and an increasing
       number of homeless people have dogs. The bond between many
       homeless people and their dogs is profound and the health
       and wellbeing of their canine companions is often a major
       priority for their owners.</p>
       <br>
    <p>Life on the streets makes it difficult to access the fundamental
       vet care required to ensure the health and vitality these dogs deserve.
       StreetVet is a registered practice with the Royal College of Veterinary
       Surgeons and has been established by a dedicated team of professional
       vets and veterinary nurses to bring that essential care to homeless
       people and their dogs across the capital. Together the StreetVet
       team take their experience out onto the streets of ever expanding
       locations, seeking out people; their dogs living rough,
       and delivering care and support required to ensure their
       combined wellbeing.</p>
    <p>Combined with the critical support of a host of renowned 
      organisations backing our team of qualified professionals,
      StreetVet is changing the future for homeless dogs who may
      otherwise have to go without the care they need and deserve.</p>

    <h1><a href="support.html">How TO Support Us</a></h1>
    <p>From donating money to fund our work, to purchasing
       items on our Amazon Wishlist or notifying us of a dog
       and its owner in need, there are many ways for you to
       support our programme.</p>
    <h1><a href="volunteer.html">How Your Support Will Be Used</a></h1>
    <p>We will use everything you give – in cash or kind – to provide
       much needed care to the homeless and their dogs across the cities
       in which we are active. This includes buying medications;
       paying for life saving operations; and equipping our team
        with the kit they need.</p>
    <h1><a href="volunteer.html">Impact You Supprot Will Have</a></h1>
    <p>By supporting StreetVet your donations will fund an increase
       in our outreach so we can have more vets on the streets helping
       more people and dogs in need. By enabling us to deliver this 
       much needed programme, we can ensure people without the resources
       to care for their pets can continue enjoying the critical
       companionship their dogs provide.</p>
