    <h1>WELCOME TO <strong>COOPVET</strong></h1>
    <p>Homelessness is a growing problem in the Nigeria and an increasing
       number of homeless people have dogs. The bond between many
       homeless people and their dogs is profound and the health
       and wellbeing of their canine companions is often a major
       priority for their owners.</p>
       <br>
    <p>Life on the streets makes it difficult to access the fundamental
       vet care required to ensure the health and vitality these dogs deserve.
       StreetVet is a registered practice with the Royal College of Veterinary
       Surgeons and has been established by a dedicated team of professional
       vets and veterinary nurses to bring that essential care to homeless
       people and their dogs across the capital. Together the StreetVet
       team take their experience out onto the streets of ever expanding
       locations, seeking out people; their dogs living rough,
       and delivering care and support required to ensure their
       combined wellbeing.</p>
    <p>Combined with the critical support of a host of renowned 
      organisations backing our team of qualified professionals,
      StreetVet is changing the future for homeless dogs who may
      otherwise have to go without the care they need and deserve.</p>
