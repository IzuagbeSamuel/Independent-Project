  <h1>It’s National Pet Month!</h1>
    <p>Spring in to action and support
       StreetVet during National Pet Month this April.</p>
       <br>
    <p>We’d like to give thanks to our four-legged
       friends by spending this month honouring them.</p>
       <br>
    <p>Since time at home has increased, every owner knows
       how important their pet is to them, especially
       in tough times. For those experiencing homelessness, 
       a pet can provide support, protection, friendship,
       and a reason to keep going.</p>
       <br>
    <p>We want to celebrate National Pet Month by highlighting the 
      human-animal bond, and the benefits that our special companions
      give us every day.</p>
      <br>
    <p>Meet Macey, she belongs to one of our lovely clients in Cornwall.
       Her owner is so grateful to have her in his life.</p>
       <br>
    <q>Macey picked me. We both needed some company at the time. We bonded,
       and we’ve not separated since. She gives me unconditional love, she’s
       mischievous and cheeky and a real daddy’s girl. She doesn’t leave my side. </q>

    <h1>WELCOME TO <strong>COOPVET</strong></h1>
    <p>Homelessness is a growing problem in the Nigeria and an increasing
       number of homeless people have dogs. The bond between many
       homeless people and their dogs is profound and the health
       and wellbeing of their canine companions is often a major
       priority for their owners.</p>
       <br>
    <p>Life on the streets makes it difficult to access the fundamental
       vet care required to ensure the health and vitality these dogs deserve.
       StreetVet is a registered practice with the Royal College of Veterinary
       Surgeons and has been established by a dedicated team of professional
       vets and veterinary nurses to bring that essential care to homeless
       people and their dogs across the capital. Together the StreetVet
       team take their experience out onto the streets of ever expanding
       locations, seeking out people; their dogs living rough,
       and delivering care and support required to ensure their
       combined wellbeing.</p>
    <p>Combined with the critical support of a host of renowned 
      organisations backing our team of qualified professionals,
      StreetVet is changing the future for homeless dogs who may
      otherwise have to go without the care they need and deserve.</p>

    <h1><a href="support.html">How TO Support Us</a></h1>
    <p>From donating money to fund our work, to purchasing
       items on our Amazon Wishlist or notifying us of a dog
       and its owner in need, there are many ways for you to
       support our programme.</p>
    <h1><a href="volunteer.html">How Your Support Will Be Used</a></h1>
    <p>We will use everything you give – in cash or kind – to provide
       much needed care to the homeless and their dogs across the cities
       in which we are active. This includes buying medications;
       paying for life saving operations; and equipping our team
        with the kit they need.</p>
    <h1><a href="volunteer.html">Impact You Supprot Will Have</a></h1>
    <p>By supporting StreetVet your donations will fund an increase
       in our outreach so we can have more vets on the streets helping
       more people and dogs in need. By enabling us to deliver this 
       much needed programme, we can ensure people without the resources
       to care for their pets can continue enjoying the critical
       companionship their dogs provide.</p>
